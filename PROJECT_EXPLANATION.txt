        PREDICTIVE DISEASE OUTBREAK DASHBOARD
        Early Warning System for Public Health
================================================================================

PROJECT TITLE:
  Predictive Disease Outbreak Dashboard

PROBLEM STATEMENT (PS5):
  Develop a predictive analytics dashboard integrating hospital admission data
  and water quality reports to forecast disease outbreaks (e.g., Cholera, Typhoid)
  up to 48 hours in advance.

================================================================================
  1. WHAT THE PROJECT DOES
================================================================================

  This dashboard serves as a real-time early warning system for public health
  authorities. It ingests two critical data streams — hospital admission records
  and water quality reports — and uses statistical ML models to:

    • Detect anomalies in disease admission patterns
    • Identify correlations between water contamination and waterborne diseases
    • Forecast outbreak trends 48 hours into the future
    • Classify geographic regions by risk level (Low / Moderate / High / Critical)
    • Generate automated alerts when thresholds are breached

  The system monitors 4 diseases: Cholera, Typhoid, Dengue, and Malaria
  across 8 geographic regions with distinct population and water supply profiles.

================================================================================
  2. HOW IT WORKS — TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE
================================================================================

  LAYER 1: DATA INGESTION & GENERATION
  -------------------------------------
  • Synthetic data generator produces realistic datasets:
    - 1,200+ hospital admission records over 30 days
    - 720 water quality reports (pH, turbidity, coliform, dissolved oxygen, etc.)
    - Anomaly injection windows simulating real outbreak scenarios
  • Data includes timestamps, GPS coordinates, disease type, severity, patient
    demographics, and water quality metrics per region.

  LAYER 2: DATA PREPROCESSING & FEATURE ENGINEERING
  --------------------------------------------------
  • Time bucketing: Records are aggregated into 6-hour and 24-hour windows
  • Rolling averages and rate-of-change computation
  • Water Quality Index (WQI) — composite score from 5 parameters:
      pH (15%), Turbidity (20%), Coliform Count (30%),
      Dissolved Oxygen (20%), Chlorine Residual (15%)
  • Feature vectors combining admission trends with water quality metrics

  LAYER 3: ML / ANALYTICS MODELS
  --------------------------------
  Three core analytical models power the predictions:

  a) ANOMALY DETECTOR (Z-Score Based)
     - Sliding window Z-score analysis on admission counts
     - Per-disease and per-region anomaly detection
     - Threshold: Z-score > 2.0 flags an anomaly
     - Pearson correlation analysis between water quality degradation
       and disease admission spikes

  b) 48-HOUR FORECASTER (Holt's Double Exponential Smoothing)
     - Exponential Moving Average (EMA) with trend component
     - Alpha = 0.3 (level smoothing), Trend Alpha = 0.1
     - Confidence intervals that widen with forecast horizon
     - Trend classification: Rising / Stable / Falling
     - MAPE-based accuracy evaluation on holdout data

  c) RISK CLASSIFIER (Multi-Factor Weighted Scoring)
     - 6 risk factors with calibrated weights:
         Admission Velocity     (30%) — rate of increase in recent admissions
         Water Quality Score    (25%) — inverse of WQI
         Severity Index         (20%) — proportion of severe cases
         Historical Risk        (10%) — baseline from past outbreak data
         Population Density      (8%) — scaled by regional population
         Trend Score             (7%) — from forecaster output
     - 4-tier output: LOW / MODERATE / HIGH / CRITICAL
     - Automated alert generation based on risk level and anomalies

  LAYER 4: REST API (Express.js)
  --------------------------------
  7 API endpoints serving processed analytics:
    GET /api/dashboard      — Full dashboard summary with KPIs
    GET /api/admissions     — Time-series admission data (filterable)
    GET /api/water-quality  — Water quality metrics by region

    GET /api/alerts         — Active alerts sorted by severity
    GET /api/hotspots       — Geospatial data for heatmap rendering
    GET /api/regions/:id    — Detailed risk breakdown for a region

  LAYER 5: FRONTEND DASHBOARD
  --------------------------------
  Single-page responsive dashboard with:
    • 4 KPI cards — admissions, alerts, active regions, 48h trend
    • Interactive Leaflet.js map with heatmap overlay and region risk circles
    • Chart.js visualizations:
        - Multi-line admission trend chart (per disease + total)
        - 48-hour forecast chart with confidence bands
        - Disease breakdown doughnut chart
        - Severity distribution bar chart
    • Live alerts sidebar with severity-based color coding
    • Risk classification panel with progress bars
    • Water Quality Index gauges per region
    • Water-disease correlation display
    • Auto-refresh every 30 seconds

================================================================================
  5. INNOVATION & DIFFERENTIATORS
================================================================================

  • CROSS-DOMAIN CORRELATION: Unlike simple dashboards, this system correlates
    water quality degradation with disease admissions to identify root causes
    of waterborne disease outbreaks before they fully develop.

  • MULTI-FACTOR RISK SCORING: Risk classification goes beyond simple thresholds.
    It combines 6 weighted factors including population density, admission
    velocity, water quality, severity trends, and historical patterns.

  • PREDICTIVE, NOT REACTIVE: The 48-hour forecast with confidence bands allows
    health authorities to take preventive action before outbreaks peak.

  • REAL-TIME MONITORING: Auto-refreshing dashboard with live status indicators
    ensures decision-makers always have the latest intelligence.

  • ACTIONABLE ALERTS: Automated severity-classified alerts with contextual
    information (Z-scores, risk scores, affected regions) enable rapid response.

================================================================================
  6. ETHICAL & PRIVACY CONSIDERATIONS
================================================================================

  This project is designed with "Privacy by Design" principles to address the
  sensitivity of medical data while delivering maximum societal benefit:

  A. DATA AGGREGATION & ANONYMIZATION
     - The system does NOT require Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
       like names, addresses, or phone numbers.
     - Hospitals only need to report aggregated counts (e.g., "5 cases of Cholera
       in Region A between 10 AM - 12 PM").
     - Utilizing k-anonymity principles ensures individual patients cannot be
       re-identified from the dataset.

  B. LEGAL COMPLIANCE (Notifiable Diseases)
     - In most countries (including India via IDSP/NCDC), hospitals are legally
       mandated to report infectious disease cases to government authorities.
     - This dashboard serves as the secure visualization layer for that legally
       mandated data flow.

  C. SOCIETAL IMPACT vs. PRIVACY
     - The trade-off leans heavily towards public good: By using anonymous
       count data, we protect individual privacy while gaining the ability to
       predict outbreaks 48 hours early.
     - Early warning allows:
       • Pre-positioning of medicines and ORS packets
       • Focused water sanitation drives in high-risk zones
       • Alerting vulnerable populations (elderly, children)
       • Preventing the spread to neighboring regions
