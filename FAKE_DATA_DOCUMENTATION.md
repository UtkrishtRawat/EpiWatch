# 📋 Fake Data Documentation

This document explains the **fake data** generated by this project.

> 🔒 **Privacy Notice:** NO personal patient identity (name, ID, exact age, address) is stored or exposed. All data is **anonymized** — only aggregate counts and statistics are used.

---

## Overview

All data is generated **in memory** when the server starts. No database or CSV files needed.

| Data Type | Count |
|-----------|-------|
| Anonymized Case Records | **10,000** |
| Water Quality Reports | **600** (20 sources × 30 days) |
| Geographic Zones | **10** |
| Diseases Tracked | **5** |

---

## 1. Anonymized Case Records (5,000 entries)

Each record represents **one disease case** with NO personal identity:

| Field | Type | Description | Example |
|-------|------|-------------|---------|
| `date` | String | Admission date (last 90 days) | `"2026-01-15"` |
| `zone` | String | Geographic zone | `"Zone A - Riverside"` |
| `disease` | String | Disease name | `"Cholera"` |
| `severity` | String | Mild / Moderate / Severe / Critical | `"Moderate"` |
| `ageGroup` | String | Age bracket (not exact age) | `"21-30"` |
| `count` | Number | Always 1 (one case per record) | `1` |
| `isActive` | Boolean | Whether case is currently active | `true` |

### ❌ What is NOT stored
- No patient names
- No patient IDs
- No exact ages
- No addresses or phone numbers
- No hospital or doctor names

### Diseases Tracked

| Disease | Description |
|---------|------------|
| **Cholera** | Waterborne bacterial infection |
| **Typhoid** | Caused by contaminated food/water |
| **Dengue** | Mosquito-borne viral disease |
| **Malaria** | Mosquito-borne parasitic disease |
| **Hepatitis A** | Viral liver infection from contaminated water |

## 2. Water Quality Reports (600 entries)

Each report is one daily reading from a water source:

| Field | Type | Range |
|-------|------|-------|
| `source` | String | 20 different water sources |
| `zone` | String | Assigned geographic zone |
| `date` | String | Last 30 days |
| `pH` | Number | Safe: 6.5-8.5, Bad: 5.0-6.0 |
| `turbidity` | Number (NTU) | Safe: 0.5-5.0, Bad: 8.0-25.0 |
| `coliformCount` | Number (CFU/100ml) | Safe: 0-10, Bad: 50-500 |
| `dissolvedOxygen` | Number (mg/L) | Safe: 5.0-9.0, Bad: 2.0-4.0 |
| `temperature` | Number (°C) | 18.0 - 32.0 |
| `isSafe` | Boolean | 70% safe, 30% contaminated |

## 3. Geographic Zones (10 zones around Delhi)

| Zone | Name | Latitude | Longitude |
|------|------|----------|-----------|
| A | Riverside | 28.6139 | 77.2090 |
| B | Old Town | 28.6200 | 77.2150 |
| C | Market Area | 28.6280 | 77.2200 |
| D | Industrial | 28.6050 | 77.1950 |
| E | Suburbs North | 28.6400 | 77.2100 |
| F | Suburbs South | 28.5900 | 77.2000 |
| G | Lake District | 28.6100 | 77.2300 |
| H | Highway Belt | 28.6350 | 77.1900 |
| I | University Area | 28.6450 | 77.2250 |
| J | Hospital Road | 28.6000 | 77.2100 |

## 4. How Analytics Use This Data

### Anomaly Detection (Z-Score Method)
- Counts daily cases per disease
- Flags days where count is **1.5+ standard deviations above average**

### 48-Hour Forecasting (Simple Moving Average)
- Uses 7-day moving average + trend analysis
- Predicts cases for next 24h and 24-48h
- Risk levels: Low / Medium / High / Critical

### Correlation Analysis
- Compares water quality (coliform, pH, turbidity) with disease counts per zone
- Flags zones with poor water AND high cases

## 5. How to Run the Project

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Start the server
npm start

# 3. Open in browser
# http://localhost:3000
```

Data regenerates fresh on every server restart (new random values each time).
